Week 3: 2/11/19-2/17/19

This week I focused on looking up some research on the senors we have avaliable to us. In particular was researching
the limitations that the sensors each had.
	-Brighter surfaces are easier for the infrared to detect since it can't detect dark surfaces very well
	-Ultrasonics aren't as good as infrared at defining edges
The rest of the team feel very condient in being able to use the senors.
I was also researching potential drive trains for the robot. So far I really like the use of mecanum for the robot.
Beginning to model our ideas. So far have just drawn them on paper. 
Hope to have some parts of the robot made next week.

Week 4: 2/18/19-2/24/19

This week I was focused only on modeling the parts of our robot. We have made the decision to design/model the final 
parts of our robot as we construct our prototype. The parts I managed to complete were the plow and the two seperate 
models that will be used to hold our camera. The plow will go in front of our robot as it drives fowards and picks up 
balls along the way. The two parts that will hold the camera are to be printed seperately and then assemble together 
for the camera. The actual body and the base that will hold the wheels are to be made next.
