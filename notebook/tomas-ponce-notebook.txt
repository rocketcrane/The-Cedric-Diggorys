Week 3: 2/11/19-2/17/19

This week I focused on looking up some research on the senors we have avaliable to us. In particular was researching
the limitations that the sensors each had.
	-Brighter surfaces are easier for the infrared to detect since it can't detect dark surfaces very well
	-Ultrasonics aren't as good as infrared at defining edges
The rest of the team feel very condient in being able to use the senors.
I was also researching potential drive trains for the robot. So far I really like the use of mecanum for the robot.
Beginning to model our ideas. So far have just drawn them on paper. 
Hope to have some parts of the robot made next week.
